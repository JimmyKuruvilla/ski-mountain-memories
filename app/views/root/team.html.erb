     I've loved to build things for as long as I can remember; I went into real estate development to be at the heart of the building process. While working in real estate, I got great feedback on financial models I built in Excel - my favorite part of the job. Eventually, I decided to find a career that would allow me to focus on those building skills, and give me the opportunity to directly create something.
     </p>

    <p>
    That following spring, I took some classes in code - it was exactly what I was looking for: The means to build something myself, and utilize both logic and creativity. A month later, after trying to teach myself to code on off-hours, I left my job to pursue web development full-time. I took some time off and spent the summer teaching myself Ruby, while teaching kids how to wakeboard in Fire Island. After I got back to the city, I enrolled at the Flatiron School. I've been loving every minute and can't wait to for what's next.

      For four years I worked as tech recruiter interacting with software developers on a daily basis. I thought it was so cool that they were able to answer questions with technology and solve problems by writing code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually my curiosity got the best of me and I started to explore what programming was actually like. I plowed through a ton of online resources including Codecademy, Code School, Odin Project, and Harvard's CS50x. After 12 months of self-study, I applied to Flatiron School to pursue my new-found passion and change my career. Here I am 10 weeks later, building an application that can track pictures from around the world!

    <h3>Jimmy Kuruvilla</h3>
    <h4>Student @ The Flatiron School</h4>
     <p>
       I am of Indian origin, I grew up in Saudi Arabia, and came to the US for college in 2001. I graduated from my combined degree program with a bachelor's degrees in Physics and Environmental Engineering in 2007. From 2007 to 2014 I have lived and worked in NYC as an environmental engineer for a consulting firm on Long Island.
     </p>

       <p>
        I sometimes had extended downtime between projects at my previous position, and I filled it by learning how to program. Python quickly became my go to language for office task scripting, and I saved myself a lot of time with automation scripts. I shared them with coworkers who needed the same routines shortened and CAMPer, PhotoRanger, SpecSorter and Serial Loader were minor hits around the water cooler. Writing those scripts were fun and engaging, but I never thought of it as a potential career. That is, until May of 2014 when I heard about coding bootcamps on the radio.
      </p>

       <p>
        It was obvious to me that if there was a chance to make programming my career, I should attempt it, as I far preferred programming to environmental consulting. I applied to The Flatiron School, and am now working hard to begin my new life as a developer.
